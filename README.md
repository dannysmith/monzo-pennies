# Monzo Pennies

Monzo's new roundup thing is very cool, but it moves money into your "Coin Jar" imediately after every transaction. I wanted to spend as normal, and then have the roundup calculated and moved into a pot every evening. Hence this little project. It's mainly meant for personal consumption, but feel free to use it. [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) applies.

#### Things to be aware of

This stores your transactions in a Postgres database on heroku, though it only stores the `tx_id`, `created`, `description`, `amount` and `currency`.

> üìù If you don't like the idea of your transactions living there, feel free to clear out the old ones by running `Transaction.where(status: 1).destroy!` or similar.

### To Deploy

1. Create a pot in Monzo for your roundups (mine's called "Savings").
2. Head over to the [Monzo API Playground](https://developers.monzo.com/api/playground) and get your access token and the `account_id` for your current account.
3. Deploy this app to:

```shell
heroku create
git push heroku master

heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
heroku addons:create scheduler:standard

heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku config:set MONZOPENNIES_BASE_URL=$(heroku apps:info -s  | grep web_url | cut -d= -f2)
```

Now go set the other environment variabled required:

```shell
heroku config:set MONZOPENNIES_SAVINGS_POT_NAME=Savings # Must match the name in Monzo
heroku config:set MONZOPENNIES_ACCOUNT_ID=XXX # Get this from the API playground
heroku config:set MONZOPENNIES_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=XXX # Set this to some random alphanumeric string
heroku config:set MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXX # Get this from the API Playground
```

Run this rake task to create the webhook:

```shell
heroku ps:restart
heroku run rake create_webhooks
```

Finally, run `heroku addons:open scheduler` and set up a job to run at whatever time you prefer. The job should run the following command:

```shell
rake save_pennies
```
